The task we are trying to solve is find a general and convenient way to access objects in a extensible class hierarchy.

Attempts seen previously:
* Classification and access methods: impractical
* Type tests and casts: unsafe, low-level
* Object-oriented decomposition: does not always work, need to touch all classes to add a new method.
