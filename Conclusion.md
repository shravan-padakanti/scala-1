### Next Courses 

* **Functional Program Design**: Apply FP in a larger context.
* **Functional Programming and State**: What does it mean to have a mutable state, what changes if we add it, how can we simulate it if we want to stay purely functional
* **Parallel Programming**:  All the programs we saw were sequential. The parallel programming course teaches how to exploit immutability for parallel execution. Useful for processing distributed collections and big data.
