> **Static vs Dynamic Binding**
> In the most general terms, static binding means that references are resolved at compile time.
> ```java
> Animal a = new Animal();
> a.Roar(); // The compiler can resolve this method call statically.
> ```
> Dynamic binding means that references are resolved at run time.
> ```java
> public void MakeSomeNoise(object a) {
>  // Things happen...
>  ((Animal) a).Roar(); // You won't know if this works until runtime!
> }
