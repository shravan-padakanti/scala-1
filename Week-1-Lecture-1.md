# Programming Paradigms

### Imperative programming 
An imperative language uses a sequence of statements to determine how to reach a certain goal. (Eg. Java)
Eg. 
```java
int total = 0;
int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 10;
total = number1 + number2; 
```
Each statement changes the state of the program, from assigning values to each variable to the final addition of those values.

* Functional programming 
A functional language takes functional approach to problem solving i.e. based on functions that are global in nature. (Eg. Python scripts)

* Logic programming
Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. The rules are written in the form of clauses (Eg. Prolog, Datalog).

* Object oriented programming
A OOP language takes an object based approach to problem solving (Eg. Java)
