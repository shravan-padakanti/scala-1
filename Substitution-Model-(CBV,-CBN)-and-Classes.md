We are familiar with the substituion model, and how expressions with simple datatypes are evaluated using CBV/CBV.

Suppose we have a class definition as follows:
```scala
class C(x1, ..., xm){ ... def f(y1, ..., yn) = b ... }
```

**Question**: How is an instantiation of the class `new C(e1, ..., em)` evaluted? <br/>
**Answer**: The expression arguments `e1, ..., em` are evaluated like the arguments of a normal function. Thatâ€™s it. The resulting expression, `new C(v1, ..., vm)`, is already a value.

**Question**:  How is an function call on an instantiation evaluated: `new C(v1, ..., vm).f(w1, ..., wn)` <br/>
**Answer**: The expression `new C(v1, ..., vm).f(w1, ..., wn)` is rewritten to:
```
[w1/y1, ..., wn/yn][v1/x1, ..., vm/xm][new C(v1, ..., vm)/this] b    // Here '/' indicates 'replaces'
```
There are three substitutions at work here:
* the substitution of the formal parameters `y1, ..., yn` of the function f by the arguments `w1, ..., wn`
* the substitution of the formal parameters `x1, ..., xm` of the class C by the class arguments `v1, ..., vm`
* the substitution of the self reference this by the value of the object `new C(v1, ..., vn)`.

Example:
```scala
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    def numer = x
    def denom = y

    def less(that: Rational) =
        numer * that.denom < that.numer * denom

    def max(that: Rational) =
        if (this.less(that)) that else this
}

// So the expression:
new Rational(1, 2).less(new Rational(2, 3))
// is evaluated as:
[1/x, 2/y] [newRational(2, 3)/that] [new Rational(1, 2)/this] less
